# Smart Farm AI ðŸŒ±ðŸ¤–

Smart Farm AI is an AI-powered farm management and decision-support system built with Streamlit and Python.  
Designed for smallholder farmers and agritech builders, it helps manage crops, track productivity, predict disease and yields, monitor sensors, and provide a multilingual smart tutor (text + voice).

## Project overview
Smart Farm AI bundles 50+ features into a single Streamlit app to support farm management and decision-making. The app runs on desktop or mobile (Streamlit) and can be extended later with Raspberry Pi-based sensors and edge inference.

Core goals:
- Make farm data actionable for smallholder farmers.
- Combine simple ML (classification/regression) with practical farm tools (inventory, loans, scheduling).
- Provide multilingual help via a Smart Tutor (text + optional voice).
- Be deployable on low-cost hardware (Raspberry Pi) or Streamlit Cloud.
